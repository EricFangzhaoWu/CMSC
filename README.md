# CMSC: Collaborative Multi-Domain Sentiment Classification

A matlab implementation of the collaborative multi-domain sentiment classification algorithm by Fangzhao Wu, Zhigang Yuan and Yongfeng Huang.

#Introduction

This source code is designed to implement the collaborative multi-domain sentiment classification approach (CMSC) proposed in reference [1]. The aim of CMSC approach is to train train domain-specific sentiment classifiers for multiple domains simultaneously in a collaborative way. The sentiment information in different domains is shared to train more accurate and robust sentiment classifiers for each domain when labeled data is scarce. In CMSC approach, the sentiment classifier of each domain is decomposed into two components, a global one and a domain-specific one. The global model can capture the general sentiment knowledge and is shared by various domains. The domain-specific model can capture the specific sentiment expressions in each domain. CMSC also incorporates the domain-specific sentiment knowledge mined from both labeled and unlabeled samples in each domain to enhance the learning of domain-specific sentiment classifiers. The similarities between different domains are incorporated into CMSC approach as regularization over the domain-specific sentiment classifiers to encourage the sharing of sentiment information between similar domains.


#Usage

1. CMSC.m

>	function [w, W] = CMSC(X, y, domain, p, P, S, alpha1, alpha2, beta, lambda1, lambda2, loss_type) 


>+ Function Description

>>The goal of this function is to train a robust global sentiment classifier across multiple domains and an accurate domain-specific sentiment classifier for each domain when a small number of labeled samples in these domains,  the domain similarities between them, the general sentiment knowledge extracted from general-purpose sentiment lexicons, and the domain-specific sentiment knowledge of each domain extracted from both labeled and unlabeled samples.

>+ Input

>>**X**:   a N*D matrix, represents the feature vectors of labeled samples from multiple domains, where N is the number of all labeled samples and D is the dimension of the feature vector.

>>**y**:   a N*1 vector, represents the sentiment labele of each labeled sample, where +1 for positive sample and -1 for negative sample.

>>**domain**:   a N*1 vector, represents the domain index of each labeled sample.

>>**p**:	a D*1 vector, represents the prior sentiment knowledge extracted from general-purpose sentiment lexicons, where +1 for positive sentiment experessions, -1 for negative sentiment experessions, and 0 for others.

>>**P**:	a D*M vector, represents the domain-specific sentiment knowledge of multiple domains, where M is the number of domains to be analyzed. P(:,m) is the domain-specific sentiment knowledge of the m-th domain.

>>**S**:    a M*M vector, represents the domain similarities. S(m,n) represents the domain similarity between domain m and domain n.

>>**alpha1**:  a non-negative real value, controls the relative importance of the prior general sentiment knowledge extracted from general purpose sentiment lexicons.

>>**alpha2**:  a non-negative real value, controls the relative importance of the domain-specific sentiment knowledge extracted from both labeled and unlabeled samples.

>>**beta**: a non-negative real value, controls the relative importance of domain similarity knowledge.

>>**lambda1**:  a non-negative real value, controls the model complexity.

>>**lambda2**:  a non-negative real value, controls the model sparsity.

>>**loss_type**:  a string, represents the loss function used in our approach.

>+ Output

>>**w**: a D*1 vector, represents the global sentiment model shared by multiple domains.

>>**W**: a N*D matrix, represents the domain-specific sentiment models of multiple domains, where W(:,m) is the domain-specific sentiment model of domain m.
